Decide: Should the @type be rdfs:Class or skos:Concept? Do we have (or intend to create) relations among entities/attributes other than the hierarchical ones (i.e., class-subclass, generic broader/narrower, part-whole), the similarity ones (exact/similar matches), and the associative ones (related terms)? If so, go for an ontology. If not, go for a skos controlled vocabulary, e.g., a "relaxed" taxonomy.
